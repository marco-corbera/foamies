## Installation

### Option 1: Install with Docker - Recommended

Docker is the easiest way to get Foamies up and running without worrying about dependencies. Here‚Äôs how to get started with Docker and Docker Compose.

#### Step 1: Install Docker and Docker Compose

Follow the instructions based on your operating system:

- **macOS**: [Install Docker Desktop for Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (which includes Docker Compose)
- **Windows**: [Install Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (Docker Compose is included)
- **Linux**: [Install Docker on Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
  - Then, install Docker Compose: [Install Docker Compose on Linux](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

#### Step 2: Clone the Repository

Clone the project to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/foamies.git
cd foamies
```

#### Step 3: Build the Docker containers: From the project root directory, run:
```bash
docker-compose build
```

#### Step 4: Start the containers:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will start both the backend and frontend in Docker containers. The frontend should now be accessible at http://localhost:3000, and the backend at http://localhost:8000.

### Option 2: Install Without Docker
If you're not using Docker or prefer to install the project the traditional way, follow these steps.

#### Step 1: Install Node.js and NVM (Frontend)
We will use Node Version Manager (NVM) to install the correct Node.js version for the frontend.

Install NVM by following the instructions at: Install [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script)

1. Install Node.js version 20.18.0:
```bash
nvm install 20.18.0
nvm use 20.18.0
```

2. Install the frontend dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the frontend development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will now be running at http://localhost:3000.

#### Step 2: Install Python 3.13 (Backend)

For the backend, we will use pyenv to install the required version of Python.
1. Install pyenv by following the instructions at: [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation)
2. Install Python 3.13:
   ```bash
   pyenv install 3.13
   pyenv global 3.13
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
   ```
4. Install the backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
The backend API will now be running on http://localhost:8000.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- React
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript

### Backend:
- Django
- Django REST Framework
- Python 3.13
- Docker: For containerized deployment

## Scripts

The following scripts are available in the project‚Äôs `package.json`:

- **dev**: Start the development server for the frontend:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
- **build**: Build the production version of the frontend:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
- **start**: Start the production server for the frontend:
  ```bash
